## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to install the project templates from `NuGet`.

    dotnet new -i Piranha.BasicWeb.CSharp
    dotnet new -i Piranha.Blog.CSharp

After that is done, just create a new project and get going.

    dotnet new piranha
    dotnet restore
    dotnet run
